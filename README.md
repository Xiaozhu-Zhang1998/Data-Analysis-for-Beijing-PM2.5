This is a repository for the final project of Class Introduction to Data Science in UCLA Extension.

## Project Description
Before the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympic Games, the severe air pollution in Beijing had already caught the whole world's attention. Among all those gauges of air pollution, PM2.5 concentration is no doubt the most famous and effective. According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the air quality index (AQI) could be regarded as “Good” if AQI is less than 50, whereas the average AQI in Beijing from 2010 to 2014 was almost 100. In order to deal with this serious problem, we use data set from UCI Repository (with time series data from 2010 to 2014) to explore the factors influencing PM2.5 in Beijing, perform machine learning algorithm to impute missing values, and comment on the trend of PM2.5 during the 5 years studied. Suggestion on how to improve air quality in Beijing is given at the end.
